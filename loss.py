    Returns:

def cdist(a, b, metric='euclidean'):
    """Similar to scipy.spatial's cdist, but symbolic.
    The currently supported metrics can be listed as `cdist.supported_metrics` and are:
        - 'euclidean', although with a fudge-factor epsilon.
        - 'sqeuclidean', the squared euclidean.
        - 'cityblock', the manhattan or L1 distance.
    Args:
        a (2D tensor): The left-hand side, shaped (B1, F).
        b (2D tensor): The right-hand side, shaped (B2, F).
        metric (string): Which distance metric to use, see notes.
    Returns:
        The matrix of all pairwise distances between all vectors in `a` and in
        `b`, will be of shape (B1, B2).
    Note:
        When a square root is taken (such as in the Euclidean case), a small
        epsilon is added because the gradient of the square-root at zero is
        undefined. Thus, it will never return exact zero in these cases.
